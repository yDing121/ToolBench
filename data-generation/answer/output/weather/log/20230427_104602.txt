Answer the following questions as best you can. General instructions are: Plugin for look up weather information. Specifically, you have access to the following APIs:

get_weather_today: Get today's the weather. Your input should be a json (args json schema): {"location" : string, } The Action to trigger this API should be get_weather_today and the input parameters should be a json dict string. Pay attention to the type of parameters.
forecast_weather: Forecast weather in the upcoming days.. Your input should be a json (args json schema): {"location" : string, "days" : integer, } The Action to trigger this API should be forecast_weather and the input parameters should be a json dict string. Pay attention to the type of parameters.

Use the following format:

Question: the input question you must answer
Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action: the action to take, should be one of [get_weather_today, forecast_weather]
Action Input: the input to the action
Observation: the result of the action
... (this Thought/Action/Action Input/Observation can repeat N times)
Thought: I now know the final answer
Final Answer: the final answer to the original input question

Begin! Remember: (1) Follow the format, i.e,

Answer the following questions as best you can. General instructions are: Plugin for look up weather information. Specifically, you have access to the following APIs:

get_weather_today: Get today's the weather. Your input should be a json (args json schema): {"location" : string, } The Action to trigger this API should be get_weather_today and the input parameters should be a json dict string. Pay attention to the type of parameters.
forecast_weather: Forecast weather in the upcoming days.. Your input should be a json (args json schema): {"location" : string, "days" : integer, } The Action to trigger this API should be forecast_weather and the input parameters should be a json dict string. Pay attention to the type of parameters.

Use the following format:

Question: the input question you must answer
Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action: the action to take, should be one of [get_weather_today, forecast_weather]
Action Input: the input to the action
Observation: the result of the action
... (this Thought/Action/Action Input/Observation can repeat N times)
Thought: I now know the final answer
Final Answer: the final answer to the original input question

Begin! Remember: (1) Follow the format, i.e,

Answer the following questions as best you can. General instructions are: Plugin for look up weather information. Specifically, you have access to the following APIs:

get_weather_today: Get today's the weather. Your input should be a json (args json schema): {"location" : string, } The Action to trigger this API should be get_weather_today and the input parameters should be a json dict string. Pay attention to the type of parameters.
forecast_weather: Forecast weather in the upcoming days.. Your input should be a json (args json schema): {"location" : string, "days" : integer, } The Action to trigger this API should be forecast_weather and the input parameters should be a json dict string. Pay attention to the type of parameters.

Use the following format:

Question: the input question you must answer
Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action: the action to take, should be one of [get_weather_today, forecast_weather]
Action Input: the input to the action
Observation: the result of the action
... (this Thought/Action/Action Input/Observation can repeat N times)
Thought: I now know the final answer
Final Answer: the final answer to the original input question

Begin! Remember: (1) Follow the format, i.e,

Answer the following questions as best you can. General instructions are: Plugin for look up weather information. Specifically, you have access to the following APIs:

get_weather_today: Get today's the weather. Your input should be a json (args json schema): {"location" : string, } The Action to trigger this API should be get_weather_today and the input parameters should be a json dict string. Pay attention to the type of parameters.
forecast_weather: Forecast weather in the upcoming days.. Your input should be a json (args json schema): {"location" : string, "days" : integer, } The Action to trigger this API should be forecast_weather and the input parameters should be a json dict string. Pay attention to the type of parameters.

Use the following format:

Question: the input question you must answer
Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action: the action to take, should be one of [get_weather_today, forecast_weather]
Action Input: the input to the action
Observation: the result of the action
... (this Thought/Action/Action Input/Observation can repeat N times)
Thought: I now know the final answer
Final Answer: the final answer to the original input question

Begin! Remember: (1) Follow the format, i.e,

Answer the following questions as best you can. General instructions are: Plugin for look up weather information. Specifically, you have access to the following APIs:

get_weather_today: Get today's the weather. Your input should be a json (args json schema): {"location" : string, } The Action to trigger this API should be get_weather_today and the input parameters should be a json dict string. Pay attention to the type of parameters.
forecast_weather: Forecast weather in the upcoming days.. Your input should be a json (args json schema): {"location" : string, "days" : integer, } The Action to trigger this API should be forecast_weather and the input parameters should be a json dict string. Pay attention to the type of parameters.

Use the following format:

Question: the input question you must answer
Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action: the action to take, should be one of [get_weather_today, forecast_weather]
Action Input: the input to the action
Observation: the result of the action
... (this Thought/Action/Action Input/Observation can repeat N times)
Thought: I now know the final answer
Final Answer: the final answer to the original input question

Begin! Remember: (1) Follow the format, i.e,

Answer the following questions as best you can. General instructions are: Plugin for look up weather information. Specifically, you have access to the following APIs:

get_weather_today: Get today's the weather. Your input should be a json (args json schema): {"location" : string, } The Action to trigger this API should be get_weather_today and the input parameters should be a json dict string. Pay attention to the type of parameters.
forecast_weather: Forecast weather in the upcoming days.. Your input should be a json (args json schema): {"location" : string, "days" : integer, } The Action to trigger this API should be forecast_weather and the input parameters should be a json dict string. Pay attention to the type of parameters.

Use the following format:

Question: the input question you must answer
Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action: the action to take, should be one of [get_weather_today, forecast_weather]
Action Input: the input to the action
Observation: the result of the action
... (this Thought/Action/Action Input/Observation can repeat N times)
Thought: I now know the final answer
Final Answer: the final answer to the original input question

--------------------
Answer the following questions as best you can. General instructions are: Plugin for look up weather information. Specifically, you have access to the following APIs:

get_weather_today: Get today's the weather. Your input should be a json (args json schema): {"location" : string, } The Action to trigger this API should be get_weather_today and the input parameters should be a json dict string. Pay attention to the type of parameters.
forecast_weather: Forecast weather in the upcoming days.. Your input should be a json (args json schema): {"location" : string, "days" : integer, } The Action to trigger this API should be forecast_weather and the input parameters should be a json dict string. Pay attention to the type of parameters.

Use the following format:

Question: the input question you must answer
Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action: the action to take, should be one of [get_weather_today, forecast_weather]
Action Input: the input to the action
Observation: the result of the action
... (this Thought/Action/Action Input/Observation can repeat N times)
Thought: I now know the final answer
Final Answer: the final answer to the original input question

Begin! Remember: (1) Follow the format, i.e,
Thought:
Action:
Action Input:
Observation:
Final Answer:
 (2) Provide as much as useful information in your Final Answer. (3) YOU MUST INCLUDE all relevant IMAGES in your Final Answer using format ![img](url), and include relevant links. (3) Do not make up anything, and if your Observation has no link, DO NOT hallucihate one. (4) If you have enough information, please use 
Thought: I have got enough information
Final Answer:
