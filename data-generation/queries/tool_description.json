It supports the following APIs: get_allname: prints all the possible synonyms (might be too many, use this function carefully); get_id_by_struct: prints the ID of the queried compound SMILES. This should only be used if smiles is provided or retrieved in the previous step. The input should not be a string, but a SMILES formula; get_id: prints the ID of the queried compound name, and prints the possible 5 names if the queried name can not been precisely matched; get_prop: prints the properties of the queried compound ID.",
